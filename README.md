# Chatbot Development Playground
Welcome to the Chatbot Development Playground! This repository is dedicated to building, testing, and experimenting with various types of chatbots, including AI-powered conversational agents, rule-based bots, and more.

## About
This repository is part of my learning journey into the world of chatbot development. I plan to develop and experiment with different types of bots, from simple rule-based chatbots to advanced AI-driven models. The goal is to build an open platform where I can experiment with various technologies and approaches, and eventually contribute back to the community with open-source projects.
