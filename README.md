# Chatbot Development Playground
Welcome to the Chatbot Development Playground! This repository is dedicated to building, testing, and experimenting with various types of chatbots, including AI-powered conversational agents, rule-based bots, and more.

## About
This repository is part of my learning journey into the world of chatbot development. I plan to develop and experiment with different types of bots — from simple rule-based chatbots to advanced AI-driven models. The goal is to build an open platform where I can experiment with various technologies and approaches, and eventually contribute back to the community with open-source projects.

## Key Features:
* AI-based chatbots: Chatbots powered by machine learning and AI, learning from user interactions.
* Rule-based chatbots: Simple bots that follow predefined decision trees and logic.
* Customizable bots: Build your own chatbot by cloning this repo and adjusting configurations.
  
## Technologies
This project will explore a wide variety of technologies and tools, including but not limited to:
* Python (for backend logic)
* NLP libraries: spaCy, NLTK, transformers
* Machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
* Rasa, Botpress, Dialogflow
* Webhooks & APIs for external integrations
* Custom UI (for web-based chat interfaces)
* Current Projects

## Below is a list of current chatbots or chatbot features being worked on:
* Weather Information Bot: A bot that fetches real-time weather data via an external API and provides weather updates.
(More bots and experiments will be added regularly as I continue learning and developing!)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have an idea for a new bot or want to improve the existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Here’s how you can get involved:
* Fork the repository
* Create a new branch
* Make your changes and commit them
